                        <li>
                            Do not make topics or posts aiming to insult or provoke other people or groups,
                            and do not promote or encourage others to make such posts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not reply to topics with irrelevant, meaningless, or spammy text/images.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not "bump" topics by posting something that does not contribute constructively to the topic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All personal issues must be dealt with in private. The public forums are not the place for personal conflicts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Criticism of the work of others, both staff and the larger community, must be delivered with
                            politeness and personal respect.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not make topics just to announce that you are quitting the game or the server. Exceptions may be
                            made if you are quitting for a very interesting reason, like you are dying, or sailing around the world.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Announcements about dramatic events befalling other players must include a verifiable source
                            for the information. If we cannot easily verify the story, the topic may be removed. Deliberate
                            hoaxes of this nature are considered very serious infractions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not reply to a topic that you feel is violating the rules, submit a report instead. Intentionally
                            lying in a report is considered an infraction.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not abuse HTML in the forums or personal profiles in a way that makes navigation difficult,
                            causes extreme browser lag, or exceeds the preset boundaries.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Unless you are explaining the report process, you may not encourage others to report a specific player.

                        <li>
                            Please do not publicly accuse any players of hacking. If you believe a player is hacking or breaking
                            any rules report them using the /report command.
                        </li>

                            You may not use any form of in game chat to solicit. Any account that is determined to be for the sole
                            use of soliciting will be permanently banned without warning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may not link to, or solicit players to join, any server public or private that is not part of the
                            Overcast Network in public chat. (You may use /msg command to inform players that request it).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your username must be appropriate, and you may be asked to use a different account if your username is
                            found to be inappropriate. (This does not count as ban evasion.)

                        <li>
                            Players may not abuse glitches. This includes, but is not limited to, placing blocks in areas restricted
                            by the plugin to walk on, creating an "x-ray" effect, and causing yourself to be invincible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a Blitz or Ghost Squadron match, players may not prolong a match by avoiding combat and/or hiding
                            in places that are inaccessible or difficult to get to.
                        </li>

                            Observers may never give tactical information to players or intentionally disrupt gameplay.
                            Tactical information includes, but is not limited to:
